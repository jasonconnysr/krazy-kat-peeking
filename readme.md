# Krazy Kat Peeking

Lightweight boilerplate for React with TypeScript.

## Requirements

- Node v12.10.0
- React 16.12

### Start front end
`yarn start` spins up an instance of a webpack dev server on port 3000 with watch enabled.

### Start mock API
`yarn api:dev` starts a mock API express server on port 8080 with respawn enabled.

## TODO

- Mobile/responsive styles
- A11y
- Forms
- hold context so app is less chatty
- Better style re-use
- surface API 4** errors to UI
- environment params
- auth vs unauth
- set internal list for list item component
